# Changelog

## [2.0.3] - 2026-07-22

- Pinned-image **Show toolbar** now keeps the original pin as the only visible image
- The annotation layer is transparent and anchored to the original pin instead of opening a replacement image surface
- The toolbar uses the capture-style grip and stays directly beneath the pinned image
- Added an explicit **Cancel** action that closes the toolbar without changing the pin
- Added regression coverage for transparent editing, Cancel visibility, and lossless output

## [2.0.2] - 2026-07-22

- Existing portable folders now remove the obsolete previous-name executable during in-place update or the next SnapAnchor startup
- Added regression coverage for cleaning unmanaged legacy apphosts left by version 2.0.0

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-22

- Removed the obsolete previous-name executable from the portable ZIP and extracted folder
- Pinned-image OCR now shows an I-beam only over recognized selectable words
- Restored the normal arrow pointer over non-text areas and after leaving recognized text

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-22

- Renamed the product, executable, installer, portable package, namespaces, assets, local storage, and update channel from SnapPin to SnapAnchor
- Added one-time migration for existing settings, capture history, pinned sessions, diagnostics, and startup registration
- Rebuilt the capture and annotation toolbar around a shared 18 px WPF vector icon system
- Reduced the compact toolbar to a light 34 px surface with restrained shadow, spacing, hover, active, and disabled states
- Retained a verified compatibility bootstrap so existing portable copies can update in place to the renamed executable

All notable user-facing changes should be recorded here. Versions follow semantic versioning where practical.

## [1.2.15] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added an explicit **Cancel** action beside Copy and All text for OCR text selections on pinned images
- Escape now cancels the active text selection before it can close the pinned image
- Clicking empty image space clears the current OCR text selection

### Changed

- Cancelling a selection keeps OCR text-selectable mode enabled so another selection can begin immediately

### Validation

- Added a pinned-image UI regression requiring the Cancel selection control
- Full x64 build, three-language localization audit, and smoke-test suite pass with zero warnings or errors

## [1.2.14] - 2026-07-21

### Validation

- Added regression checks requiring valid high-resolution window icons on the dashboard and Preferences dialog
- Full x64 build, localization audit, smoke-test suite, and isolated live Windows taskbar review pass

## [1.2.13] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added an independent **Check for updates every day** option beside the existing startup check
- Daily checks run at most once per local calendar day and continue while SnapAnchor remains open across midnight
- Manual update checks count toward the daily schedule to avoid an immediate duplicate check
- Added Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese translations for the new setting

### Validation

- Added date-boundary, same-day, future-timestamp, default-setting, and Preferences-control regression checks
- Full x64 build, three-language localization audit, rendered About-page review, and smoke-test suite pass with zero warnings or errors

## [1.2.12] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Reduced Preferences from 680 x 540 to a compact 620 x 470 logical-pixel layout for better use on scaled and smaller displays
- Reduced tab padding, typography, button padding, field heights, margins, toolbar list sizes, and label-column widths
- Added automatic vertical scrolling to every Preferences tab and horizontal overflow scrolling to the two-column Toolbar page
- Kept Cancel and Save changes fixed at the bottom while tab content scrolls independently

### Validation

- Added a regression requiring all ten Preferences tabs to expose automatic vertical scrolling
- Rendered and reviewed every tab at 620 x 470
- Full x64 build, localization audit, and smoke-test suite pass with zero warnings or errors

## [1.2.11] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- The default annotation toolbar now follows Snipaste's compact order: Rectangle, Arrow, Pencil, Marker, Blur, Text, and Eraser
- The default capture actions are now Cancel, Pin, Save, and Copy; other supported actions remain available from Toolbar Preferences

- Existing untouched toolbar defaults automatically migrate to the new layout while custom layouts are preserved

### Validation

- Added exact default-order and settings-column regression checks

## [1.2.10] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Capture History now follows SnapAnchor's cool light design instead of the legacy dark window
- Added a spacious header with distinct teal, sky-blue, and coral actions

- Full x64 build, localization audit, history behavior checks, and smoke-test suite pass with zero warnings or errors

## [1.2.9] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Portable updates now retry with administrator permission when Windows unexpectedly denies replacement of an existing application file
- The elevated retry is offered only after the previous version was restored successfully, preventing unsafe retry loops
- Portable update failures now identify whether backup, replacement, or obsolete-file removal failed and name the affected package file

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for safe access-denied retry classification
- Full x64 build, localization audit, updater transaction tests, and smoke-test suite pass with zero warnings or errors

## [1.2.8] - 2026-07-20

### Validation

### Added

- Quiet startup update notification with a persistent tray action
- Release-details window showing version, edition, download size, notes, and GitHub link

- Only the two newest portable rollback copies are retained

### Fixed

- Portable update failures now restore overwritten, deleted, and newly created managed files transactionally
- User-created files beside the portable application are excluded from managed-file cleanup
- Read-only folders trigger elevation before replacement, and insufficient disk space is detected before files change

### Validation

- Successful portable replacement and deliberately failed version validation both covered by real filesystem tests
- Complete x64 release build, localization audit, and smoke-test suite pass with zero warnings or errors

## [1.2.6] - 2026-07-20

- Language changes restart through the single-instance handoff without racing the previous process

### Validation

- Every visible static XAML label is covered by the localization dictionary
